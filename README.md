# top-landing-page
Making a landing page as a part of The Odin Project curriculum.

The project went decently. It was somewhat easier than last time (June, 4-5m ago) because I remembered some of the stuff from before.

Things to pay attention to and to work on:
  - Setting the width of the page (+ how to do so)
  - Setting the width of certain elements and divisions on the page
  - How many divs and "display:flex" are necessary
  - Choosing colors and fonts beforehand and giving them names (+ how to do so)
  - Learn properly the differences between Justify and Align (for flex)
  - Learn the differences between self, items and content for justify and align
  - Learn how to set up the file from the get go (I remember something box: nothing or something like that and no margin, etc.)

It took me roughly 3 to 4 hours to do this project, but if I were to do it again now I don't think it would take me more than 2h.
